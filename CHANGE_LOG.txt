Version 1.7.0 (2016-09-12)
  - The option "fontincrement" has been added. It saves the font size
    used by tkPacman.
  - Correction in the help text: the hyperlink to "Partial upgrades
    are unsupported" has been corrected.

Version 1.6.1 (2015-10-13)
  - The button "Check Upgrades" was renamed to "List Upgrades".
  - tkPacman no longer calls the pacman script "checkupdates" but
    provides the same functionality by setting up a temporary copy of the
    package database at /tmp/tkpacman, where /tmp/tkpacman/local is a
    symbolic link to /var/lib/pacman/local, and by calling:
        fakeroot -- pacman --sync --refresh --dbpath /tmp/tkpacman
        pacman --query --upgrades --dbpath /tmp/tkpacman
    This gives the user more feedback on the progress than 'checkupdates'
    which hides all feedback on the progress from pacman.
  - The parsing of /etc/pacman.conf was completely rewritten. Up to now
    it is used by tkPacman to get the list of sofware repositories and
    the value of DBPath (default /var/lib/pacman).

Version 1.6.0 (2015-09-27)
  - The button "Resync Database", which called 'pacman --sync --refresh',
    has been replaced with a button "Check Upgrades", which calls
    'checkupdates'. I would like to thank Alad Wenter for pointing out
    to me that 'pacman --sync --refresh' is unsafe in the sense that it
    increases the risk for a "partial upgrade". See also the pacman wiki
    on the Archlinux website. The help text of tkPacman has been updated
    accordingly.
  - For the time being, the call to 'checkupdates' is preceded by
    setting LANG=en_US.UTF-8. This is necessary now to work around a bug
    in 'checkupdates' for the Dutch locale. See
    https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/46405
  - The template for the terminal 'lxterminal' has been removed. I
    have noticed that if an lxterminal is already running outside
    tkPacman, lxterminal returns control to tkPacman immediately, even
    before the command '%c' has started. Therefore, I can no longer
    recommend it for use with tkPacman.
  - The template for the terminal 'roxterm' was modified. The option
    '--separate' was added to it. This was necessary to prevent it form
    reusing the process of another already running roxterm.
  - A new menu item was added to the Pacman menu:
    "Optimize pacman database". It calls 'pacman-optimize'.
  - The Dutch translation of "repository" was changed from "depot" to
    "archief".


Version 1.5.0 (2014-04-13)
  - The action 'Clean cache' in menu 'Pacman' now offers the choice
    to clean up all packages or only the ones that are no longer
    installed.
  - The statement 'Defaults env_keep += "HOME"' which was recommended
    in the help text for configuring 'sudo' has some undesired effects.
    The help text has been changed accordingly. If you are using
    tkPacman in KDE, it is probably better to use 'kdesu' instead
    of 'sudo' and to remove the offending statement form /etc/sudoers
    by calling 'visudo'.

Version 1.4.0 (2014-01-03)
  - tkPacman now also remembers packages marked for installation or
    removal across mode switches (from 'Available packages' to
    'Installed packages' or vice versa).
  - It is possible to mark packages for removal if there are already
    packages marked for installation or vice versa.
  - When the 'Apply changes' button is pressed, first the packages
    marked for removal are removed and then the packages marked for
    installation are installed.

Version 1.3.1 (2013-11-29)
  - Ticket number 5. tkPacman crashes on startup in most non-English
    locales. Solved in procedure parseFirst in main.tcl.

Version 1.3.0 (2013-11-2)
  - Important error messages are not printed to stderr, but are stored
    in internal memory and can be viewed by pressing the 'Errors' button
    on the toolbar. Additionally, the 'Errors' button's icon changes
    from gray to red when new errors have occurred. This has been done
    to help new users who propably don't know what is happening when
    the 'terminal' or 'runasroot' options are calling uninstalled
    programs.

Version 1.2.0 (2013-10-30)
  - tkPacman now remembers packages marked for installation or
    removal across filter changes. Only when the user changes from
    'available packages' to 'installed packages' or vice versa,
    the pending operation has to be applied or forgotten.
  - There is a new filter called 'Marked' which lists all marked
    packages in one view.
  - Templates for terminals 'xfce4-terminal' and 'konsole have been
    added for option 'terminal'.
  - Template for 'kdesu' has been added for option 'runasroot'.
  - The file chooser has been slightly improved.
  - Option 'tmpdir' can also be changed with the file chooser.
  - Help text for option 'tmpdir' has been added.
  - General help function has been added under menu Help -> Display help.
  - The problem of ugly background colour differences under KDE has
    been solved.

Version 1.1.0 (2013-10-23)
  - Filter 'upgrades' now uses 'pacman --query --upgrades' instead
    of "pacman --sync --sysupgrade --print --print-format %n". Thanks
    to Fabien Coutant (see ticket nr 2 on sourceforge:
    http://sourceforge.net/p/tkpacman/tickets/2/).
  - The option 'sudo' has been replaced with a more flexible 'runasroot'
    option which makes it possible for the user to choose an alternative
    authentication program such as gksu. Thanks again to Fabien Coutant
    (see ticket nr 3 on sourceforge:
    http://sourceforge.net/p/tkpacman/tickets/3/)
  - The warning message for filter 'upgrades' now appears in the lower
    text pane instead of in a popup window.
  - The way 'sudo' is used has been improved. tkPacman provides a
    grapphical helper for getting the user's password. Because sudo
    is now called directly from tkPacman, sudo's feature of caching
    the user's password during a certain time (default 5 minutes) now
    also works in the context of tkPacman.

Version 1.0.6 (2013-09-23)
  - Informative message when using filter 'upgrades' has been added.

Version 1.0.5 (2013-09-10)
  - First stable release
  - Clean pacman cache has been added
  - Some corrections to Dutch translation
  - Small optimisation of 'refreshPackageList'

Version 1.0.b4 (2013-09-05)
  - Some corrections for Dutch translation
  - When possible, filter stays active on mode switch.
  - Small improvements of help text for option terminal.
  - Cleanup of code.

Version 1.0.b3 (2013-09-02)
  - Modified procedure for finding URL in info. The original procedure
    relied on a text search for "URL : ". This did work for locale
    nl_NL.UTF-8, but not for locale en_GB.UTF-8 and probably neither
    for many other locales. The new procedure just looks for "http://"
    or "https://".
  - Icon was modified again.

version 1.0.b2 (2013-09-01)
  - Dutch translation has been added
  - New button on toolbar for "Local Package"
  - New icon

version 1.0.b1 (2013-08-25)
  - First beta version of tkPacman.
