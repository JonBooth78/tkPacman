Version 1.1.0 (2013-10-23)
  - Filter 'upgrades' now uses 'pacman --query --upgrades' instead
    of "pacman --sync --sysupgrade --print --print-format %n". Thanks 
    to Fabien Coutant (see ticket nr 2 on sourceforge:
    http://sourceforge.net/p/tkpacman/tickets/2/).
  - The option 'sudo' has been replaced with a more flexible 'runasroot'
    option which makes it possible for the user to choose an alternative
    authentication program such as gksu. Thanks again to Fabien Coutant
    (see ticket nr 3 on sourceforge:
    http://sourceforge.net/p/tkpacman/tickets/3/)
  - The warning message for filter 'upgrades' now appears in the lower
    text pane instead of in a popup window.
  - The way 'sudo' is used has been improved. tkPacman provides a
    grapphical helper for getting the user's password. Because sudo
    is now called directly from tkPacman, sudo's feature of caching
    the user's password during a certain time (default 5 minutes) now
    also works in the context of tkPacman.

Version 1.0.b3 (2013-09-02)
  - Modified procedure for finding URL in info. The original procedure
    relied on a text search for "URL : ". This did work for locale
    nl_NL.UTF-8, but not for locale en_GB.UTF-8 and probably neither
    for many other locales. The new procedure just looks for "http://"
    or "https://".
  - Icon was modified again.
