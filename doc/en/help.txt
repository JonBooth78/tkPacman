<b>Concept</b>

Using the radio buttons just below the toolbar, you can switch between 'Available packages' and 'Installed packages'.

Available packages can be fetched from the software repositories defined in /etc/pacman.conf.

If 'Available packages' are displayed, you can mark packages for installation.

If 'Installed packages' are displayed, you can mark packages for removal.

In both modes you can apply filters to reduce the number of packages that are displayed.

The special filter 'Marked' lists the packages that are marked for installation or removal.

By pressing the 'Apply Changes' button you can install or remove the marked packages.


<b>Resync Database</b>

pacman keeps a database with information about the packages in the software repositories.

This database needs to be kept up to date by executing the 'pacman --sync --refresh' command.

You can do this by just pressing the 'Resync Database' button.

This does not upgrade any packages.


<b>System Upgrade</b>

By pressing the 'System Upgrade' button the pacman command 'pacman --sync --refresh --sysupgrade' is executed.

This resyncs the database and upgrades all packages to their latest available version.


<b>Configuring 'sudo'</b>

To use 'sudo' in the 'runasroot' option, you may need to configure 'sudo'.

There are many ways to configure sudo. But here is a way that usually works.

First add your account to the group 'wheel'. Don't forget to logout and login again after that.

Then edit the /etc/sudoers file by running the command 'visudo' as 'root'.

Uncomment or add the line

%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

For some desktop environments (e.g. KDE), you need to uncomment or add the following line

Defaults env_keep += "HOME"

Without it you cannot open a window as root in KDE. You can test it by typing the command

sudo konsole

in a terminal (konsole) window.

By adding a line

Defaults timestamp_timeout = 10

you can set the time that sudo caches your password to 10 minutes instead of the default 5 minutes.


<b>Problems with setting 'terminal' and 'runasroot' options</b>

If you have problems with setting the 'terminal' or 'runasroot' options, start tkPacman from a terminal window by typing 'tkpacman' instead of starting it from the desktop menu.

tkPacman will then display error and warning messages on the terminal which may help you to solve the problems.
